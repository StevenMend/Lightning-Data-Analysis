# Lightning Data Analysis

This project explores lightning strike data collected by NOAA to analyze its distribution over time and space. The goal is to efficiently structure the data to identify relevant patterns and answer key questions related to lightning activity.

## Approach
Using a Jupyter Notebook, we analyze the data and visualize patterns. The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Statistical analysis of lightning patterns.
- Visualization of temporal and spatial trends.

## Data Files
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
- `datos1.csv`: Dataset 1 with lightning strike data.
- `datos2.csv`: Dataset 2 with supplementary information.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
