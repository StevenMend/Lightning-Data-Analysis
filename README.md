# Lightning Data Analysis

This project explores lightning strike data collected by NOAA to analyze its distribution over time and space. The goal is to efficiently structure the data to identify relevant patterns and answer key questions related to lightning activity.

## Objectives
Throughout the analysis, we perform the following tasks:
- Identify the locations with the highest number of lightning strikes in a single day.
- Determine which locations experienced the greatest number of days with at least one lightning strike.
- Examine whether certain days of the week show differences in lightning activity.
- Explore how lightning strikes are distributed across months and calculate monthly proportions.

## Initial Hypotheses
1. Locations with the highest number of lightning strikes may have specific geographic or climatic factors.
2. Certain days of the week may show more lightning activity than others due to weather patterns.
3. There may be significant differences in lightning activity between months of the year, possibly related to specific seasons.

## Approach
Using a Jupyter Notebook, we analyze the data and visualize patterns. The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Statistical analysis of lightning patterns.
- Visualization of temporal and spatial trends.

## Data Files
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
- `datos1.csv`: Dataset 1 with lightning strike data.
- `datos2.csv`: Dataset 2 with supplementary information.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StevenMend/Lightning-Data-Analysis.git
